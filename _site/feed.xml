<h1 id="eudaimen-ethics">Eudaimen Ethics</h1>

<p>by Aristotle</p>

<h2 id="publishers-summary">Publisher’s Summary</h2>
<!-- No more than a couple paragraphs summarizing this BOOK -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Aristotle’s moral philosophy is a pillar of Western ethical thought. It bequeathed to the world an emphasis on virtues and vices, happiness as well-being or a life well lived, and rationally motivated action as a mean between extremes. Its influence was felt well beyond antiquity into the Middle Ages, particularly through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. In the past century, with the rise of virtue theory in moral philosophy, Aristotle’s ethics has been revived as a source of insight and interest. While most attention has traditionally focused on Aristotle’s famous Nicomachean Ethics, there are several other works written by or attributed to Aristotle that illuminate his ethics: the Eudemian Ethics, the Magna Moralia, and Virtues and Vices.</p>

<!-- The main content of my thoughts really -->

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>11-2 Aristotle not concerned with morality in the modern sense</p>
<h4 id="text">Text</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>33 happiness is most noble, best of all things, and pleasantest
- possible paths to happiness: nature, learning (knowledge), training, divine influence, fortune
34 every person has an overarching telos
35 mix of experience and reason is necessary to find good life
41 happiness = "best of what are matters of human action"
42 ANTI-PLATO: Idea of good cant direct action
44 Idea of good not "useful"
45 virtue = best state/task of object, person, etc.
- ex. garment
46 task/ergon = action, project, deed
- task &gt; state (hexis): so its more about what you do than who you are
- ex. cobbler's virtue
47 def. happiness
- happ. is activity/use
49 excess vs. deficiency
- ex. food
51 golden mean
53 virute spectrums are abstract states corresponding to a variety of concrete manifestations
54 states/capacities are related to emotions, which are distinguished by pleasure and pain
57 only humans can act
58 virtue/vice only apply to voluntary acts
59 3 types of desire: will, passion, appetite
61 voluntary action is deliberative
- desire and reason both play a part in human action
62-3 pleasure and pain exist in both vice/virtue
65 def. of voluntary: all a man does without being ignorant, on his own initiative, and having the power not to do so (last is most interesting, and prob why A analyzes the problem of incontinence so much)
68 def. of choice
- choice "arises out of deliberative belief"
69 process of deliberation
70 argument connection virtue/vice to pleasure/pain (not directly, obviously; see p. 62)
- moral virtue = mean; vice = excess or deficiency
- "vice [...] is concerned with the same matters as virtue"
78 "virtue implies choice"
93 justice = complete virtue; because best man is not he who is only virtuous to himself but also to others
97 justice = proportion
98 justice = rectification
105 justice applies to the different and multiple, not the selfsame!
106 universal vs. particular
111 contrary to popular belief, acting just is NOT easy: "Men think that acting unjustly is in their power, and therefore that being just is easy. But it is not: to lie with one's neighbour's wife, to strike one's neighbour, to offer a bribe, is easy and in our power, but to do these things from a certain state of character is neither easy nor in our power."
- ex. easy to bribe, cheat, etc., but not as easy to be just
- being just requires specific knowledge of "how actions must be done and distributions effected" and is more than just knowing what is good (e.g. health)
- ex. specific causality of healthy objects
111-2 unjust (and just) acts require real effort, the kind that builds character: "to act unjustly consists not in doing these things, except coincidentally, but in doing them from a certain state of character, just as to practise medicine and to heal consists not in applying or not applying the knife, in using or not using drugs, but in doing so in a certain way."
113 no universals, only probability, when it comes to action
117 calculate = deliberate
- reason must be true and desire must be correct for choice to be virtuous
118 action (good and bad) requires both thought and character
- 5 kinds of knowing: craftsmanship, knowledge, wisdom (phronesis), understanding, intelligence
119 def. knowledge
- craft = producing; =/= action
120 phronesis = good deliberation
- concerns what can be otherwise
- production vs. action
121 "wisdom is a virtue not a craft"
123 good action = deliberation on universals and particulars
124 universals and particulars
- phronesis is same disposition as art of politics
- phronesis is like a political reason foucsed on the individual alone
- phronesis directs oneself; justice directs other
126 correctness in deliberation, NOT belief or knowledge
- not just WHAT, but HOW
127 judgement vs. wisdom/phronesis: both concern deliberative problems, but only wisdom issues commands for action (a key diff between ethics and morality!!)
128 sympathy is a "similar sense" of another and ground of equity
- in greek, "sense" is part of "sympathy" (as in, similar sense) cf. Schopenhauer
- universals reached from particulars
129 raw experience is just as much of a guide to universals as demonstration!
130 virtue is the aim; wisdom is the means
- goodness requires a state that involves both wisdom and virtue
131 "it is impossible to be wise without being good"
135 "the wise man is a man of action"
138 particulars, not universals, concern action
- incontinence is a misapplication of the universal to the particular
- knowledge takes time and becomes part of us
143 excess vices are either brutish or diseased
148 depravity/vice = disease; incontinence = epilepsy (i.e. momentary)
- virtue/vice encourge/destroy our PURPOSE respectively
152 habit is like nature, but not identical (both can be changed)
160 friendship is a kind of "private justice" wholly in our power
164 three types of friendship basis: utility, virtue, pleasantness
166 universal and personal good must align; politics forces this alignment for those who don't have it
167 "the task of every capacity is external; for it is in something different or in oneself *qua* different"
170 "all have some good in them" (e.g. singers)
174 good = simple, self-identical, static
178 only adults can be good/friends to themselves because they have the "power of choice", which children and animals lack
189 living = knowing
196 phronesis is not knowledge, but "another kind of cognition"
202 two kinds of good fortune: divine (consistent) and natural (inconsistent). both lack reason.
203 combo of all virtues = gentlemanliness
- the goods that all strive for (honor, riches, bodily virtues, power, good fortune) can be harmful to people without the right "states of character"
204 gentlemen deserve "riches, high birth, and power" in virtue of their noble character. these things are not noble for most people, who dont have the character to virtuously wield these goods
- "complete virtue" - deeds done for the sake of virtue itself
206 ultimate ethical goal: "to perceive the irrational part of the soul, as such, as little as possible"

<h1 id="individuation-in-light-of-notions-of-form-and-information">Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information</h1>

<p>by Gilbert Simondon</p>

<h2 id="publishers-summary">Publisher’s Summary</h2>
<!-- No more than a couple paragraphs summarizing this BOOK -->

<blockquote>
  <p>A long-awaited translation on the philosophical relation between technology, the individual, and milieu of the living From Democritus’s atomism to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, from Aristotle’s reflections on the individual to Husserl’s call for a focused return to things, from the philosophical advent of the Cartesian ego and the Leibnizian monad to Heidegger’s notion of Dasein, the question concerning the constitution of the individual has continued to loom large over the preoccupations of philosophers and scholars of scientific disciplines for thousands of years. Through conceptions in modern scientific areas of research such as thermodynamics, the fabrication of technical objects, gestalt theory, cybernetics, and the dynamic formation at work in the creation of crystals, Gilbert Simondon’s unique multifaceted philosophical and scholarly research will eventually lead to an astounding reevaluation and questioning of the historical methods for posing the very question and notion of the individual. More than fifty years after its original publication in French, this groundbreaking work of philosophical theory is now available in its first complete English language translation.</p>

<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>by Benedict de Spinoza</p>

<h2 id="publishers-summary">Publisher’s Summary</h2>
<!-- No more than a couple paragraphs summarizing this BOOK -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Published shortly after his death, the Ethics is undoubtedly Spinoza’s greatest work - an elegant, fully cohesive philosophical system that strives to provide a coherent picture of reality, and to comprehend the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, the emotions, human bondage to the emotions, and the power of understanding - moving from a consideration of the eternal, to speculate upon humanity’s place in the natural order, the nature of freedom and the path to attainable happiness. A powerful work of elegant simplicity, the Ethics is a brilliantly insightful consideration of the possibility of redemption through intense thought and philosophical reflection.</p>

<!-- The main content of my thoughts really -->

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#### I: God/substance
2 attributes determine identity
3 causal relation establishes commonality
	There is nothing but substances and their affections
5 modifications do not exist outside intellect
	Clear and distinct = true
	Existence/essence of substance is eternal truth
6 more reality = more attributes
7 God exists
8 perfection and existence increase/decrease in unison
10 only substances and modes exist
	Body = "any quantity, with length, breadth, and depth, limited by some certain figure"
15 essence vs. existence
16 God is immanent cause of all things
19 particular things are just affections/modes of God's attributes
	Modes are nothing but affections of God's attributes
20 remote causes
	Natura naturata (passive nature) vs. natura naturans (active nature)
21 intellect is a mode of thinking (differing from desire, love, etc.)
	Will is a mode of thought, and is not free
	"we can understand nothing that does not lead to more perfect knowledge of the intellection"
22 God doesn't "create" anything (anti-Creationism)
	Necessary vs. impossible
23 contingency is a defect of knowledge
	Ascribing freedom to God is a "great obstacle of science"
	God could never decree anything different
25 summary of God's properties
27 mathematics allows humanity to attain divine knowledge
	"All final causes are nothing but human fictions"
29 "the will of god, that is, the sanctuary of ignorance" (contra intelligent design)
29-30 human values determined by what is most pleasing to us
30 good/evil judgments are based on human preferences (via imagination)
	People also like to imagine that God likes/establishes harmony
	The imagination is the source of all this error, and distracts from the actual nature of things
31 for the majority of people, perfection = what is most pleasurable/useful

#### II: human mind and body
31 body is conceived in a "certain and determinate way"
32 ideas are concepts, not precepts
	Adequate vs. true
	Collective agency
34 God's power must not be confused with human power or right of kings
	Ideas not caused by object or perception, but by God
35 necessary path of implication: attribute of thought -&gt; ideas -&gt; objects
	Immanence of the "order and connection" of ideas and things
	Thought and extension are "one and the same substance" explained through different attributes (monism)
	Ideas must be explained through thought alone; things through extension alone
36 EMERGENT PROPERTIES
37 causal chain always leads back to God
38 first priority of philosophy: investigate God
	First constitutive element of a human mind is an idea
39 the object of this constitutive idea is the human body (both of which exist in God)
40 human exists with both mind and body, which are united
41-3 physical doctrine of bodies
	Bodies differentiated by speed and slowness
	Simple vs. composite bodies
	Speed is more important to identity than substance or parts
	Nature can be thought of as a single individual composed of many parts
44 postulates of the human body
	V: skin and memory, inscription
	The mind perceives everything that happens in the body
	Atomism of ideas (each idea composed of partial ideas)
45 causality requires similar nature
	Correlationism: ideas of external bodies indicate our own body more than anything outside of it (and reference to Appendix I)
	Memory
	Habit, leads to error
46 definitions of image and imagine
	Imagination does not always lead to error
	Relation between imagination and habit (in producing error)
	Definition of memory
47 two orders of connection: affections vs. ideas
	Linguistic arbitrariness of the sign thesis
	Relativity of imagination leads to different habits and associations
	Ex. Farmer vs. soldier
	Mind does not know body exists, only knows its affections
48 order and connection of ideas same as for causes (monism)
	Idea of idea: ideas are nested in each other
49 mind perceives affections of body and ideas of these affections
	Mind does not know itself, except through ideas of bodily affections
50 external bodies determine the human body in a certain way (as in structuralist differential signification?)
	Correlationism; External reality is imaginary
51 ideas of affections are confused ideas ("conclusions without premises")
	Ideas arrived at through the body lead to a "mutilated and confused" knowledge
52 internal ("agreements, differences, and oppositions") vs. external (ideas of affections) knowledge
53 free will theory based on ignorance of the cause of one's actions
54 inadequate ideas follow with same necessity as adequate ones
	Things that are common to all must be conceived adequately
56 confused origin of TRANSCENDENTALS and UNIVERSALS (via imagination)
	Even these notions are relative to an individual's experience
57 FOUR LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE: random experience, opinion or imagination, reason, intuition
58 "true idea involves the highest certainty"; truth is the standard of itself (59)
59-60 time is imaginary
60 modes involve the concept of their attribute (i.e. you can always trace the cause from the effect)
62 no free will
	No absolute faculties (any distinction among mental faculties are "complete fictions")
	Reference to Appendix I
	Definition of will: affirming to denying something. ("Not the desire by which the mind wants a thing or avoids it")
63 definition of idea: a concept of thought, not an image
	The will is the intellect
64 goal of this doctrine is to be able to "arrange one's life wisely," and to speculate
	Ideas involve affirmation or negation
	Word and images are merely "corporeal motions," not concepts of thought
66 perception is not indifferent
67 not sure how highly we should esteem suicides, children, fools, and madmen
67-8 ethical and social benefits of the doctrine (foreshadowing of final chapter)

#### III: emotional psychology, or the affects
69 nature has no defect
	Affects (emotions) are part of nature and work by the same necessity
	Human actions and appetites must be analyzed like "planes, lines, and bodies"
70 definition of affect: increase/decrease in power of acting (or idea of this power)
	Affect is either action or passion
	Body retains "traces" of objects
	By having adequate ideas, the mind also "acts"
71 more inadequate ideas correlate to more passions; more adequate ideas to more actions
	Monism
72 body operates partly autonomously from mind
	Ex. Animals, sleepwalkers
73 infant, angry child, timid, drunk, madman, chatterbox, child
	Decision and determination are really the same
	Decision requires recollection/memory
74 free decisions are imaginary; those who believe in them "dream with open eyes"
75 no self-destruction
	CONATUS Principle: each thing strives to preserve in its being
	This striving = actual essence of thing
76 will vs. appetite: will is striving of the mind; appetite is striving of mind and body, thus the "very essence of man"
	Appetite = desire
	Definition of desire: "Appetite together with the consciousness of the appetite"
	"we neither strive for, nor will, neither want, nor desire anything because we judge it to be good; on the contrary, we judge something to be good because we strive for it, will it, want it, and desire it."
77 joy (passing to greater perfection) vs. sadness (passing to lesser perfection)
	These are both passions, also can be called pleasure/pain, cheerfulness/melancholy
	Three primary affects: joy, sadness, desire
	Mind strives to imagine what increases its power
78  imagination leads to affects in the body
	Love vs. hate (both related to an external cause)
	Habit/imagination can lead to imaginary/ghostly affections: felt, but not really existing
	Imagination of the mind indicates affects of the body more than existence of external objects
80 vacillation of mind: experience of contrary affects
81 hope, fear, confidence, despair, gladness, remorse
82 pity, favor, indignation
83 pride: "a species of madness" where "the man dreams, with open eyes"
84 overestimation, scorn, imitation/emulation
	We strive to free from suffering things we pity
85 benevolence, ambition, human kindness, praise, blame
86 love of esteem, shame, self-esteem, repentance
	Agreement with others empowers our preferences or dislikes
87 desire to have similar preferences as others
	The same nature that makes men compassionate also makes them envious/ambitious
	Children are proof of this entire emotional psychology
89 longing
91 affect is origin of judgement (cf. 76)
	Timidity, sense of shame, consternation
92 anger, vengeance, reciprocal love, thankfulness/gratitude, cruelty
93 "hate…can be destroyed by love"
94 class hatred and racism (just part of our nature) [EUGENIC LOGIC!]
95 love for free things &gt; love of necessary things; so, men love each other more than things
	Good/bad omens
96 principle of difference (all affects and people are different)
	There are as many judgements as affects
	Intrepid, daring, timid, cowardly
97 repentance and self-esteem can be very "violent"
	Wonder, veneration, consternation, dread, devotion, disdain
98 mockery, contempt
	The mind empowers itself as it more distinctly conceives of and rejoices in its power
	Mind strives to only imagine empowering things
	Humility, self-love, self-esteem (onto 99)
99 inherent competition: natural inclination to hate and envy
	Education bolsters competition, since parents teach children to value honor/envy
	Virtue = power of acting
100 every object produces its affect in a different way (as many species of sadness or whatever as there are objects)
	And just as many species of desire
	Gluttony, drunkenness, lust, greed, ambition: not affects or passions, since they have no opposite
101 "desire is the very nature, or essence, of each [individual]"
	Joy and sadness are markers of the increasing or decreasing of desire/appetite (either toward greater or lesser perfection)
102 for each species, their own affects 
	Exs. : horse, insects, etc. ; gladness of a drunk vs. of a philosopher
	All of the past discussion concerned passions, the rest concerns actions
103 moderation, sobriety, presence of mind in danger, courtesy, mercy
	Our contingent fortune makes us feel like we are lost at sea (Stoic metaphor!)
	Enjoyment leads to a new constitution
	Ex. Food and drink, leading to disgust, weariness
104 "appetite is the very essence of man, insofar as it is determined to do what promotes his preservation"
	Joy/sadness is necessarily a PASSAGE
105 primitive or primary affects: joy, sadness, desire
107 pity = compassion
108  right and wrong
	Developmental psychology, children, education
	Relativity of experience/values based on education
109 those we believe to be most humble are usually most envious 
111 cruelty opposed to mercy
	Ambition is always present in desire
112 full definition of affect

#### IV: Bondage/power of affects
113 def. of bondage: fortune &gt; autonomy
114 changing definition of perfection
	Universals complicit in relative perfection
	Appendix I
	Final cause = human appetite
115 humanity conscious of appetite but not its cause (cf. Schopenhauer's principle of will)
	Reality = perfection
	Appendix I
	Good and evil only modes of thinking
	Definition of Good and Evil
116 Beings change according to perfection ("passage"), not essence
117 virtue = power = essence of man
118 human perseverance to exist is limited
119 "the affect stubbornly clings to the man"
120 power struggle of the affects (immanent forces)
	Good and evil = affects (of joy and sadness)
121 Good/evil only conceptually distinct from affect
	Time limits affective force (more present = stronger)
123 truth can't influence affect except as an affect itself (affect &gt; knowledge)
124 goal of investigating reason is determining limits of action
125 dictates of reason
	Virtue = acting from natural laws
	Foundation of virtue = self-preservation
	Virtue is its own reward
	Prohibition of suicide (since contrary to foundation)
	We can never live without dealing with things outside us
126 self-interest is just, honorable, and basis of morality
126-7 only external causes lead one away from self-preservation
	Suicide is the result of external causes dominating
127 "striving to preserve oneself is the first and only foundation of virtue"
128 acting = living = preserving our being
	Only what leads to understanding is useful
129 mind's greatest virtue = to know God
130 a thing is good if it agrees with our nature
131 man is changeable
133 man who helps himself also helps others
	Virtuous action is rational action
134 definition of morality (and honor)
	Friendship
135 contra animal rights
	We can use animals as we please

<p>For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598">Stackoverflow answer</a>. You must indent your code by <strong>(3 * bullet_indent_level)</strong> spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">1.</span> We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
<span class="p">
   1.</span> Like this:<span class="sb">

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

</span><span class="p">   2.</span> The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which displays:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Like this:</p>

        <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers</code> to true in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:</p>

<p>{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br /> code code code <br /> {% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linenos</code> triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
