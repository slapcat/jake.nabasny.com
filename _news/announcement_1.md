title: New LXD Remote with Custom Images
---

Self-hosting and sharing our own infrastructure becomes increasingly important as governments and corporations attempt to control, monitor, and commodify cyberspace. To this end, I host a public image server for the [LXD hypervisor](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/). I hope the curated images available here enable others to build and host their own services.

```
lxc remote add nabasny nabasny.com:8443
```

The following images are currently available:

- Elementary OS (Desktop)
- Windows Server 2016 (Evaluation Copy)
- Windows Server 2019 (Evaluation Copy)
