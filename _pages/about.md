# Who am I?

After ten years as an educator and researcher, I completed my PhD in Comparative Literature in 2020. My career as a scholar culminated in an award-winning dissertation about the history of eugenics, soon to be published as Paper Weapons: A Historical Epistemology of American Eugenics. Since then, I've transplanted my philosophical and literary interests in subjectivity to the technical domain of identity and access management.

# The Beginning

I have been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember. When I was young, the computer was the quintessential place to fiddle with gadgets and build my own systems out of nothing. I taught myself several web programming languages. Mostly though, I would code in Visual Basic 6. One of my earliest creations was a basic alarm clock. Before the time of smart phones, if you wanted to wake up to something other than a bell ringing, you needed to download a costly MIDI ringtone to a cell phone or use a radio with an alarm feature. Lacking either of those options, I developed an alarm clock program that would play any sound file I chose. I woke up every day to a song from my friendâ€™s band (you can listen to it performed live here: That Night Will Always be Remembered). I doubt many teens from the early 2000s can say the same!
